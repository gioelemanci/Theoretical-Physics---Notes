\chapter{Quantum Gases}

Quantum gases are systems of non-interacting or weakly interacting particles that obey quantum statistics. Depending on the nature of the particles, they can be classified as either bosons or fermions, leading to different statistical behaviors.

A quantum gas can be described using the grand canonical ensemble, where the number of particles can fluctuate, and the system is characterized by a fixed temperature \(T\), volume \(V\), and chemical potential \(\mu\); the Hamiltonian operator for a quantum gas of non-interacting particles can be expressed, for a fixed \(N\), as
\[
    \hat{H} = \sum_{i}^N \hat{\mathcal{O}}_i = \sum_{i}^N \left( \frac{\hat{p}_i^2}{2m} + U(\hat{q}_i) \right),
\]
where \(\hat{\mathcal{O}}_i\) is the single-particle operator, \(\hat{p}_i\) and \(\hat{q}_i\) are the momentum and position operators of the \(i\)-th particle, \(m\) is the mass of the particles, and \(U(\hat{q}_i)\) is the potential energy operator acting on the position of the \(i\)-th particle.

In second quantization, we can express the Hamiltonian operator in terms of creation and annihilation operators \(\hat{a}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}\) and \(\hat{a}_{\alpha}\) for the single-particle states:
\[
    \hat{H} = \sum_{\alpha \beta} t_{\alpha \beta} \hat{a}_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{\beta},
\]
where the ladder operators satisfy the appropriate commutation or anticommutation relations depending on whether the particles are bosons or fermions: the nature of the particles determines the algebra of the creation and annihilation operators, which in turn affects the statistical properties of the quantum gas.
Looking at the ON base for the single-particle Hamiltonian \(\hat{\mathcal{O}}\), we can deduce a more useful form for our hamiltonian, diagonalized in terms of single-particle energy eigenstates \(\ket{e_{\alpha}}\) with eigenvalues \(\epsilon_{\alpha}\):
\[
    \hat{\mathcal{O}} \ket{e_{\alpha}} = \epsilon_{\alpha} \ket{e_{\alpha}},
\]
so that the full Hamiltonian operator can be expressed as
\[
    \hat{H} = \sum_{\alpha} \epsilon_{\alpha} \hat{a}_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{\alpha},
\]
where \(\hat{a}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}\) and \(\hat{a}_{\alpha}\) are the creation and annihilation operators for the single-particle state \(\ket{e_{\alpha}}\), forming the number operator \(\hat{n}_{\alpha} = \hat{a}_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{\alpha}\) that counts the number of particles in the state \(\ket{e_{\alpha}}\).

Thus we can define
\[
    \hat{H} - \mu \hat{N} = \sum_{\alpha} (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\alpha},
\]
where \(\hat{N} = \sum_{\alpha} \hat{n}_{\alpha}\) is the total number operator for the system.
The density operator for the quantum gas in the grand canonical ensemble is given by
\[
    \hat{\rho}_{gc} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}} e^{-\beta (\hat{H} - \mu \hat{N})} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}} e^{-\beta \sum_{\alpha} (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\alpha}},
\]
and the grandcanonical partition function can be computed as
\[
    \mathcal{Z} = \Tr_{\mathcal{F}}(e^{-\beta (\hat{H} - \mu \hat{N})}) = \Tr_{\mathcal{F}} \left( e^{-\beta \sum_{\alpha} (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\alpha}} \right),
\]
where we can construct the Fock space \(\mathcal{F}\) as the tensor product of the single-particle state spaces:
\[
    \ket{n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots} = C (\hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger})^{n_1} (\hat{a}_{2}^{\dagger})^{n_2} \cdots \ket{0},
\]
with \(C\) a normalization constant and \(\ket{0}\) the vacuum state. The occupation numbers \(n_{\alpha}\) indicate how many particles occupy the single-particle state \(\ket{e_{\alpha}}\). Now we can compute the grand partition function exploiting the trace
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{Z} & = \sum_{n_1=0}^{n_{\text{max}}} \sum_{n_2=0}^{n_{\text{max}}} \cdots \bra{n_1, n_2, \ldots} e^{-\beta \sum_{\alpha} (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\alpha}} \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots}                           \\
                    & = \sum_{n_1,\,n_2,\,\cdots} e^{-\beta \sum_{\alpha} (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) n_{\alpha}} \bra{n_1, n_2, \ldots} \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots}                                                                          \\
                    & = \sum_{n_1,\,n_2,\,\cdots} \prod_{\alpha} e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) n_{\alpha}} = \prod_{\alpha} \left( \sum_{n_{\alpha}=0}^{n_{\text{max}}} e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) n_{\alpha}} \right),
    \end{aligned}
\]
where we swapped the sums and products since the indices are independent (note how the sum changed index). The upper limit \(n_{\text{max}}\) of the sums over occupation numbers depends on the nature of the particles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for bosons, \(n_{\text{max}} = \infty\), since multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state;
    \item for fermions, \(n_{\text{max}} = 1\), due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quantum Statistics}

We can now derive the specific forms of the grand partition function and related thermodynamic quantities for fermionic and bosonic quantum gases.
We need to compute the sum over occupation numbers for each case, rememnbering that we cannot accept divergences to infinity in the partition function, since it must be finite and well defined (imagine trying to compute the TD limit).

\paragraph{Fermionic case.}
For fermions, the occupation numbers \(n_{\alpha}\) can only take values 0 or 1. Therefore, the sum over occupation numbers for each single-particle state \(\alpha\) gives the following result grand partition function:
\[
    \mathcal{Z}_{F} = \prod_{\alpha} \left( \sum_{n_{\alpha}=0}^{1} e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) n_{\alpha}} \right) = \prod_{\alpha} \left( 1 + e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \right).
\]
From the grand partition function, we can derive the grand potential \(\Omega_F\) for the fermionic quantum gas, in order to relate thermodynamic quantities to the partition function:
\[
    \Omega_F = - \frac{1}{\beta} \log \mathcal{Z}_F = - \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{\alpha} \log \left( 1 + e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \right).
\]
Now it is time to compute the average occupation number \(\langle n_{\alpha} \rangle\) for each single-particle state \(\alpha\) in the fermionic quantum gas. This quantity represents the expected number of particles occupying the state \(\ket{e_{\alpha}}\), and it's the core of \textbf{Fermi-Dirac statistics}:\footnote{The computation will be done after some result from the Bosonic case.}
\begin{equation}
    \langle n_{\alpha} \rangle_{F} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} + 1}.
    \label{eq:fermi_dirac_distribution}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Bosonic case.}
For bosons, the occupation numbers \(n_{\alpha}\) can take any non-negative integer value (0, 1, 2, ...). Therefore, the sum over occupation numbers for each single-particle state \(\alpha\) gives the following result for the grand partition function:
\[
    \mathcal{Z}_{B} = \prod_{\alpha} \left( \sum_{n_{\alpha}=0}^{\infty} e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) n_{\alpha}} \right) = \prod_{\alpha} \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)}},
\]
where we used the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\footnote{It is crucial that the series converges, it's not guaranteed for all values of \(\mu\) and \(\epsilon_{\alpha}\), and surely it's not only a way to reconduce to a prettier mathematical expression, as we will highlight.} Since the geometric series \(\sum_{n}x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}\) converges only for values of \(x < 1\), we get a prescription on the exponent:
\[
    e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} < 1 \iff \epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu > 0 \iff \mu < \min_{\alpha}\{\epsilon_{\alpha}\},
\]
meaning that, since we can take \(\min_{\alpha}\{\epsilon_{\alpha}\} = 0\), the chemical potential \(\mu\) must be negative for the bosonic quantum gas to ensure convergence of the grand partition function; this condition has important physical implications, especially when considering phenomena like \textbf{Bose-Einstein condensation}.
From the grand partition function, we can derive the grand potential \(\Omega_B\) for the bosonic quantum gas:
\[
    \Omega_B = - \frac{1}{\beta} \log \mathcal{Z}_B = \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{\alpha} \log \left( 1 - e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \right).
\]
Finally we get to derive the \textbf{Bose-Einstein statistics}, computing the average occupation number \(\langle n_{\alpha} \rangle\) for each single-particle state \(\alpha\) in the bosonic quantum gas:
\begin{equation}
    \langle n_{\alpha} \rangle_{B} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} - 1}.
    \label{eq:bose_einstein_distribution}
\end{equation}

It is good practice to compact the expressions for the two different statistics in a single formula: from the grand partition function
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{Z}_{B/F} = \prod_{\alpha} \left(1 \mp e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{\alpha} -\mu)}\right)^{\mp 1},
    \label{eq:quantum_gas_grandpartition}
\end{equation}
where the upper sign refers to bosons and the lower sign to fermions. Fo the grandpotential we have
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_{B/F} = \pm \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{\alpha} \log \left(1 \mp e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)}\right),
    \label{eq:quantum_gas_grand_potential}
\end{equation}
and finally we are able to compute explucitly the average occupation number for both statistics at the same time:
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \langle \hat{n}_{\alpha} \rangle^{B/F}_{gc} & = \Tr_{\mathcal{F}}(\rho_{gc} \hat{n}_{\alpha}) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_{B/F}} \Tr_{\mathcal{F}} \left( e^{-\beta (\hat{H} - \mu \hat{N})} \hat{n}_{\alpha} \right)                                      \\
                                                    & = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_{B/F}} \Tr _{\mathcal{F}} \left( e^{-\beta \sum_{\gamma} (\epsilon_{\gamma} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\gamma}} \hat{n}_{\alpha} \right)                                                    \\
                                                    & = \frac{-1}{\beta\mathcal{Z}_{B/F}} \Tr_{\mathcal{F}}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon_{\alpha}} e^{-\beta \sum_{\gamma}(\epsilon_{\gamma} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\gamma}}\right)                        \\
                                                    & = \frac{-1}{\beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon_{\alpha}} \log \mathcal{Z}_{B/F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon_{\alpha}} \Omega_{B/F} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \mp 1},
    \end{aligned}
\]
where again the upper sign refers to bosons and the lower sign to fermions, recovering equations \eqref{eq:fermi_dirac_distribution} and \eqref{eq:bose_einstein_distribution}. We can now interpret these results: the average occupation number \(\langle n_{\alpha} \rangle\) gives the expected number of particles occupying the single-particle state \(\ket{e_{\alpha}}\) at thermal equilibrium. The difference in the denominators reflects the fundamental distinction between bosons and fermions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For bosons, the minus sign in the denominator allows for the possibility of multiple particles occupying the same quantum state, leading to phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, where a macroscopic number of bosons can occupy the ground state at low temperatures.
    \item For fermions, the plus sign in the denominator enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, which prohibits multiple fermions from occupying the same quantum state. This leads to the characteristic filling of energy levels up to the Fermi energy at absolute zero temperature.
\end{itemize}

It is also interesting to analyze the behavior of these distributions compared to the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/Quantum_and_classical_statistics.png}
    \caption{\small Comparison of quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein) with classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The plot illustrates how the average occupation number \(\langle n_{\alpha} \rangle\) varies with energy \(\epsilon_{\alpha}\) for different temperatures \(T\) and chemical potentials \(\mu\). At high energies or low densities, all three distributions converge, reflecting classical behavior. However, at low energies or high densities, quantum effects become significant, leading to deviations from classical predictions. Notably, the Bose-Einstein distribution allows for a divergence in occupation number as energy approaches the chemical potential, indicating the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation. In contrast, the Fermi-Dirac distribution approaches a maximum occupation of 1 due to the Pauli exclusion principle.}
    \label{fig:quantum_statistics_comparison}
\end{figure}

Let us compute the internal energy \(E\) of the quantum gas using the average occupation numbers derived above:
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        E & = \langle \hat{H} \rangle^{B/F}_{gc} = \Tr_{\mathcal{F}}(\rho_{gc} \hat{H}) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_{B/F}} \Tr_{\mathcal{F}} \left( e^{-\beta (\hat{H} - \mu \hat{N})} \hat{H} \right) \\
          & = - \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \log \mathcal{Z}_{B/F} \big\vert_z,
    \end{aligned}
\]
where the subscript \(\big\vert_z\) indicates that the derivative is taken at constant fugacity \(z = e^{\beta \mu}\). Expanding this expression, we have
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        E & = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_{B/F}} \Tr_{\mathcal{F}} \left( e^{-\beta \sum_{\alpha} (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu) \hat{n}_{\alpha}} \sum_{\alpha} \epsilon_{\alpha} \hat{n}_{\alpha} \right) \\
          & = \sum_{\alpha} \epsilon_{\alpha} \left( \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_{B/F}} \Tr_{\mathcal{F}} \left( e^{-\beta (\hat{H} - \mu \hat{N})} \hat{n}_{\alpha} \right) \right)                   \\
          & = \sum_{\alpha} \epsilon_{\alpha} \langle \hat{n}_{\alpha} \rangle^{B/F}_{gc} = \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\epsilon_{\alpha}}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \mp 1}.
    \end{aligned}
\]
So the internal energy of the quantum gas can be expressed as a sum over all single-particle states, weighted by their respective energies and average occupation numbers according to either Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac statistics
\begin{equation}
    \langle \hat{H} \rangle^{B/F}_{gc} = \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\epsilon_{\alpha}}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \mp 1},
    \label{eq:quantum_gas_internal_energy}
\end{equation}
where we have not made any assumptions about the specific form of the single-particle energy levels \(\epsilon_{\alpha}\); this expression is quite general and can be applied to various quantum gas systems, including those confined in different potentials or geometries. Let us now specialize to the case of non-relativistic 3D quantum gases confined in a cubic box of volume \(V = L^3\) with periodic boundary conditions.

\section{Non Relativistic 3D Quantum Gases}

For a non-relativistic quantum gas confined in a cubic box of volume \(V = L^3\) with periodic boundary conditions, the single-particle energy levels \(\epsilon_{\alpha}\) can be expressed in terms of the kinetic energy of the particles
\[
    \epsilon_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m},
\]
from the solution of the Schrödinger equation for a free particle in a box:
\[
    - \frac{\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2m} \ket{\psi} = \epsilon \ket{\psi}.
\]
The allowed wavevectors \(\mathbf{k}\) are quantized due to the boundary conditions, leading to discrete energy levels given by
\[
    \mathbf{k} = \frac{2\pi}{L} (n_x, n_y, n_z), \quad n_x, n_y, n_z \in \mathbb{Z},
\]
so that the energy levels can be rewritten as
\[
    \epsilon_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2) \implies \epsilon_{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{2\pi}{L} \right)^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2).
\]

The key thermodynamic quantities for the quantum gas can be computed using the expressions derived earlier, substituting the specific form of the energy levels \(\epsilon_{\mathbf{n}}\): from the grand partition function
\[
    \mathcal{Z}_{B/F} = \prod_{\mathbf{n}} \left(1 \mp e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{\mathbf{n}} -\mu)}\right)^{\mp g},
\]
where \(g\) is the discrete degeneracy factor accounting for internal degrees of freedom (e.g., spin), we can derive the grand potential, internal energy, and average number of particles:
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \Omega_{B/F} & = \pm \frac{g}{\beta} \sum_{\mathbf{n}} \log \left( 1 \mp e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\mathbf{n}} - \mu)} \right), \\
        E_{B/F}      & = g\sum_{\mathbf{n}} \frac{\epsilon_{\mathbf{n}}}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\mathbf{n}} - \mu)} \mp 1},           \\
        N_{B/F}      & = g\sum_{\mathbf{n}} \frac{1}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\mathbf{n}} - \mu)} \mp 1}.
    \end{aligned}
\]

If we now consider the thermodynamic limit, where the volume \(V\) goes to infinity while keeping the particle density \(N/V\) constant, we can replace the sums over discrete states with integrals over continuous momentum space.
\[
    \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \to \sum_{\mathbf{n}} \xrightarrow{TD} (?)
\]
In order to perform this substitution, we need to determine the density of states in momentum space. The strategy is to look at the volume element in \(\mathbf{k}\)-space corresponding to each quantum state
\[
    \begin{dcases}
        \Delta k_j = \frac{2\pi}{L} \left((n_j + 1) - n_j \right) = \frac{2\pi}{L} \\
        \Delta k_x \Delta k_y \Delta k_z = \left( \frac{2\pi}{L} \right)^3 \Delta n_x \Delta n_y \Delta n_z = \frac{(2\pi)^3}{V},
    \end{dcases}
\]
which in the thermodynamic limit becomes infinitesimal \(L \to \infty \implies \Delta k_j \to 0\) (and we computed \(\Delta n_j = 1\)). Therefore, the number of states in a volume element \(\mathrm{d}^{3\mathbf{k}} \) in \(\mathbf{k}\)-space is given by
\[
    \sum_{\mathbf{n}} (\Delta n_x)(\Delta n_y)(\Delta n_z) \longrightarrow \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} (\Delta k_x) (\Delta k_y) (\Delta k_z),
\]
where we know that \((\Delta n_x)(\Delta n_y)(\Delta n_z) = 1\) since we are counting each discrete state and \((\Delta k_x)\) \((\Delta k_y)\) \((\Delta k_z)\) is the infinitesimal volume \(\mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{k}\) element in \(\mathbf{k}\)-space. Thus we pass from the sum over discrete states to an integral over continuous momentum space as
\[
    \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \longrightarrow \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} \int \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{k}.
\]
We can use polar coordinates in momentum space, since the energy levels depend only on the magnitude of the wavevector \(k = |\mathbf{k}|\), leading to
\[
    \int \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{k} = 4\pi \int_0^{\infty} k^2 \mathrm{d}k \implies \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \longrightarrow \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} 4\pi \int_0^{\infty} k^2 \mathrm{d}k = \frac{V}{2\pi^2} \int_0^{\infty} k^2 \mathrm{d}k.
\]
The final step is to change the integration variable from \(k\) to the energy \(\epsilon\), using the relation \(\epsilon = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}\), which gives
\[
    k^2 \mathrm{d} k \to \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2} \frac{\epsilon^{\tfrac12}}{2} \mathrm{d} \epsilon,
\]
so that we can express the sum over states as
\[
    \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \longrightarrow \frac{V}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2} \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\infty} \epsilon^{\tfrac12} \mathrm{d} \epsilon = V \int g(\epsilon) \mathrm{d} \epsilon.
\]
Here, we have introduced the \textbf{density of states} \(g(\epsilon)\) for a non-relativistic 3D quantum gas, defined as
\begin{equation}
    g(\epsilon) = \frac{g}{4\pi^2} \left( \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \right)^{3/2} \epsilon^{1/2} = A \epsilon^{1/2},
    \label{eq:3d_free_quantum_gas_density_of_states}
\end{equation}
which gives the number of available quantum states per unit energy interval at energy \(\epsilon\), where we have included the discrete degeneracy factor \(g\) from the internal degrees of freedom. For a generic system, the strategy to compute the density of states \(g(\epsilon)\) involves finding the relationship between the energy levels and the quantum numbers characterizing the states, then determining how many states fall within a given energy range (compute the volume in quantum number space corresponding to that energy range).

For a generic thermodynamic quantity that can be expressed as a sum over states \(\sum_{\alpha} f(\epsilon_{\alpha})\), we can now write it as an integral over energy using the density of states:
\[
    \sum_{\alpha} f(\epsilon_{\alpha}) \longrightarrow V \int_0^{\infty} g(\epsilon) f(\epsilon) \mathrm{d} \epsilon,
\]
so that we can express the grand potential, internal energy, and average number of particles for the non-relativistic 3D quantum gas in the thermodynamic limit as\footnote{Remember that the internal degeneracy factor \(g\) has already been included in the density of states \(g(\epsilon)\).}
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \Omega_{B/F} & = \pm \frac{V}{\beta} \int_0^{\infty} g(\epsilon) \log \left( 1 \mp e^{-\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \right) \mathrm{d} \epsilon, \\
        E_{B/F}      & = V \int_0^{\infty} g(\epsilon) \frac{\epsilon}{e^{\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \mp 1} \mathrm{d} \epsilon,                       \\
        N_{B/F}      & = V \int_0^{\infty} g(\epsilon) \frac{1}{e^{\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \mp 1} \mathrm{d} \epsilon.
    \end{aligned}
\]
These integrals can be evaluated using special functions, such as the polylogarithm function or power series, to obtain explicit expressions for the thermodynamic quantities of interest in terms of temperature, chemical potential, and volume.

Now, by some developments of these expressions, we can get interesting results and laws.

\paragraph{Equation of state.}
If we integrate by part the expression for the grandpotential \(\Omega_{B/F}\), we get
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \Omega_{B/F} & = \pm \frac{AV}{\beta} \left[ \frac{2}{3} \epsilon^{\tfrac32} \log \left( 1 \mp e^{-\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \right) \Big\vert_0^{\infty} - \int_0^{\infty} \frac{2}{3}\epsilon^{\tfrac32} \frac{\pm \beta e^{-\beta (\epsilon - \mu)}}{1 \mp e^{-\beta (\epsilon - \mu)}} \mathrm{d} \epsilon \right]                  \\
                     & \qquad  \lim_{\epsilon \to \infty} \log(1 \mp 0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \epsilon^{\tfrac32} \log(1 \mp e^{\beta \mu}) \Big\vert_{\epsilon = 0} = 0,                                                                                                                                                                \\
                     & \qquad A \tfrac{2}{3} \epsilon^{\tfrac32} = \tfrac{2}{3} \epsilon g(\epsilon),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\
                     & = \mp \frac{V}{\beta} (\pm \beta) \frac{2}{3}\int_0^{\infty}g(\epsilon) \frac{\epsilon e^{-\beta (\epsilon - \mu)}}{1 \mp e^{-\beta (\epsilon - \mu)}} \mathrm{d} \epsilon = - \frac{2}{3} V \int_0^{\infty} g(\epsilon) \frac{\epsilon}{e^{\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \mp 1} \mathrm{d} \epsilon = - \frac{2}{3}E_{B/F},
    \end{aligned}
\]
where we used the expression for the internal energy \(E_{B/F}\) in the last step. Thus we have derived an important relation between the grand potential and the internal energy for a non-relativistic 3D quantum gas: since the pressure \(p\) is related to the grand potential by \(p = - \frac{\Omega}{V}\), we can express the equation of state for the quantum gas as
\[
    pV = \frac{2}{3} E_{B/F}.
\]

\subsection{Power Series Expansion}

Now we have expressions for the thermodynamic quantities as integrals over energy, we can evaluate these integrals using power series expansions. We will analyze the average number of particles \(N_{B/F}/V = n_{B/F}\) and the pressure \(p_{B/F}\) in detail
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{B/F} & = A \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\epsilon^{1/2}}{e^{\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \mp 1} \mathrm{d} \epsilon,             \\
        p_{B/F} & = \frac{2}{3} A \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\epsilon^{3/2}}{e^{\beta (\epsilon - \mu)} \mp 1} \mathrm{d} \epsilon.
    \end{aligned}
\]
The idea is to perform a change of variable, since these expressions are impossible to evaluate directly written in this form (we will not get a simple solution, but a form from which it will be easy at least to compute the limits in temperature). Let us define the fugacity \(z = e^{\beta \mu}\) and perform the change
\[
    \beta \epsilon = x^2 \implies \beta \mathrm{d} \epsilon = 2x \mathrm{d}x,
\]
which will let us find a power series and also gaussian integrals, as we will show. Thus, it is possible to rewrite the expressions for the particle density and pressure as
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{B/F} & = \mathcal{C} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{z x^2}{e^{x^2} \mp z} \mathrm{d} x = \mathcal{C} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{z x^2e^{-x^2}}{1 \mp ze^{-x^2}} \mathrm{d} x,                                 \\
        p_{B/F} & = \frac{2}{3\beta} \mathcal{C} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{zx^4}{e^{x^2} \mp z} \mathrm{d} x = \frac{2}{3\beta} \mathcal{C} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{zx^4e^{-x^2}}{1 \mp ze^{-x^2}} \mathrm{d} x,
    \end{aligned}
\]
where we have defined the constant\footnote{It comes from the change of variable, which left us with \(\frac{2A}{\beta^{3/2}} = 2 \frac{g}{4\pi^2} \left( \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \right)^{3/2} \beta^{-3/2}\).}
\[
    \mathcal{C} = \frac{4g}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{1}{\lambda_{T}^3}, \quad \lambda_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hbar^2}{mk_B T}}.
\]
In both integrals we find the term \(\frac{z e^{-x^2}}{e^{-x^2}\mp z}\), which we can expand as a power series in \(z e^{-x^2}\) paying attention to the convergence conditions and the signs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for bosons, we have
          \[
              \frac{z e^{-x^2}}{1 - z e^{-x^2}} = z e^{-x^2}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (z e^{-x^2})^l = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (z e^{-x^2})^{l+1},
          \]
          which converges for \(\vert z e^{-x^2} \vert < 1\), always true since \(z < 1\) for bosons;
    \item for fermions, we have
          \[
              \frac{z e^{-x^2}}{1 + z e^{-x^2}} = z e^{-x^2}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{l} (z e^{-x^2})^l = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{l} (z e^{-x^2})^{l+1},
          \]
          which converges for all \(z \notin ]-\infty,\, -1]\) for the alternating series, but since for fermions \(z > 0\) it always converges;
    \item we can thus write a single expression for both cases:
          \[
              \frac{z e^{-x^2}}{e^{-x^2} \mp z} = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} (z e^{-x^2})^{l+1}.
          \]
\end{itemize}
Substituting this series expansion into the integrals for \(n_{B/F}\) and \(p_{B/F}\), we get
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{B/F} & = \mathcal{C} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} z^{l+1} \int_0^{\infty} x^2 e^{-(l+1)x^2} \mathrm{d} x,                  \\
        p_{B/F} & = \frac{2}{3\beta} \mathcal{C} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} z^{l+1} \int_0^{\infty} x^4 e^{-(l+1)x^2} \mathrm{d} x.
    \end{aligned}
\]
The integrals appearing in these expressions are standard gaussian integrals, which can be computed using the formula
\[
    \int_0^{\infty} x^{2n} e^{-ax^2} \mathrm{d} x = \frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^{n+1}} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^{2n+1}}}, \quad a > 0,
\]
where \((x)!! = (x)(x - 2) \cdots 3 \cdot 1\) is the double factorial\footnote{Starting from \(2n-1\) we know it is an odd number and thus the product goes down by 2 each time until the unity.}. Applying this formula to our integrals, we find
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \int_0^{\infty} x^2 e^{-(l+1)x^2} \mathrm{d} x & = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4}\frac{1}{(l+1)^{3/2}},     \\
        \int_0^{\infty} x^4 e^{-(l+1)x^2} \mathrm{d} x & = \frac{3 \sqrt{\pi}}{8} \frac{1}{(l+1)^{5/2} }.
    \end{aligned}
\]
Substituting these results back into the expressions for \(n_{B/F}\) and \(p_{B/F}\), we obtain
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{B/F} & = \mathcal{C} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} z^{l+1} \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4} \frac{1}{(l+1)^{3/2}} = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{3/2}},                         \\
        p_{B/F} & = \frac{2}{3\beta} \mathcal{C} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} z^{l+1} \frac{3\sqrt{\pi}}{8} \frac{1}{(l+1)^{5/2}} = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\pm 1)^{l} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{5/2}}.
    \end{aligned}
\]
These series expansions provide a way to compute the particle density and pressure of the quantum gas in terms of the fugacity \(z\) and temperature \(T\). They are particularly useful for analyzing the behavior of the system in different regimes, such as low or high temperatures, and for comparing the properties of bosonic and fermionic gases. We can make the notation lighter by defining the functions
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        f_{\nu}(z) & = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{l} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}} \quad \text{(Fermions)}, \\
        g_{\nu}(z) & = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}} \quad \text{(Bosons)},
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:fermi_bose_functions}
\end{equation}
so that we can rewrite the expressions for the particle density and pressure as
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{B/F} & = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \begin{dcases}
                                                f_{3/2}(z), & \text{(Fermions)}; \\
                                                g_{3/2}(z), & \text{(Bosons)};   \\
                                            \end{dcases}       \\
        p_{B/F} & = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} \begin{dcases}
                                                      f_{5/2}(z), & \text{(Fermions)}; \\
                                                      g_{5/2}(z), & \text{(Bosons)}.   \\
                                                  \end{dcases}
    \end{aligned}
\]

\subsection{Classical Limit} \label{sec:classical_limit_quantum_gas}

We can now analyze the classical limit of the quantum gas, by stopping at the first order (\(l=0\)) in the power series expansions derived above: this is justified because in the classical limit the fugacity \(z\) is much smaller than 1 (\(z \ll 1\)), so higher-order terms in the series become negligible. Thus, for the density we have
\[
    n = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} z \implies z = \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g},
\]
which can be substituted back into the expressions for the pressure to obtain
\[
    p = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} z = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} = \frac{n}{\beta} = n k_B T,
\]
recovering the classical ideal gas law \(pV = N k_B T\).

This limit corresponds to the regime where quantum effects are negligible, and the behavior of the gas can be described by classical statistics. The classical limit is typically valid when the thermal wavelength \(\lambda_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi \hbar^2}{m k_B T}}\) is much smaller than the average interparticle distance, which occurs at \textbf{high temperatures or low densities}:
\[
    z \ll 1 \implies \text{ high } T \text{ or low } n.
\]
In this regime, both bosonic and fermionic quantum gases behave like classical ideal gases, and the differences in their quantum statistics become irrelevant: we can show this result explicitly by looking at the average occupation numbers for bosons and fermions in the limit \(z \ll 1\):
\[
    \langle n_{\alpha} \rangle^{B/F}_{gc} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha} - \mu)} \mp 1} \sim e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha}-\mu)} \quad \text{for } z \ll 1,
\]
which is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for classical particles.

A final remark can be made about the expression of the chemical potential in the classical limit: since \(z = e^{\beta \mu} \ll 1\), we have \(\beta \mu \ll 0\) and thus we can recover
\[
    n = \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} e^{\beta \mu} \implies \mu = - \frac{3}{2} k_B T \log \left( \frac{m k_B T}{2 \pi \hbar^2} \left(\frac{n}{g}\right)^{\tfrac{2}{3}} \right) \xrightarrow{T \to \infty} -\infty,
\]
which shows that in the classical limit the chemical potential diverges to negative infinity as the temperature increases.

\paragraph{Semiclassical expansion.}
If we now consider the next order in the power series expansions for the particle density and pressure, we can derive corrections\footnote{We are considering semiclassical limit, called like that beacause the statistic is almot classical, but we are in a regime where we cannot ignore contributions due to the quantum nature of the considered particles.} to the ideal gas law that account for quantum effects. Including the second term (\(l=1\)) in the series, we have
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{B/F} & = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \left( z \pm \frac{z^2}{2^{3/2}} \right),       \\
        p_{B/F} & = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} \left( z \pm \frac{z^2}{2^{5/2}} \right).
    \end{aligned}
\]
Solving for \(z\) in terms of \(n\), we find
\[
    \frac{z^2}{2\sqrt{2}} \pm z \mp \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} = 0 \implies z = \sqrt{2} \left( \mp 1 \pm \sqrt{1 \pm \sqrt{2} \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g}}\right),
\]
we solved the second order equation: the first and third signs are due to Bosonic or fermionic nature, the second to the choice of solution of the quadratic equation. Expanding the square root for small \(n \lambda_{T}^3/g\), since \(z \ll 1\) implies small \(n\), we can use the Taylor expansion of the radical \(\sqrt{1+x} \sim 1 + \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{8} + \cdots\) for \(x \ll 1\), leading to
\[
    z_{B/F} \sim \sqrt{2} \left[ \mp 1 \pm \left( 1 \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} - \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g}\right)^2 \right) \right] = \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} \mp \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} \right)^2.
\]
If we now substitute this expression for \(z\) back into the pressure, and keep terms up to second order in \(n \lambda_{T}^3/g\), we find
\[
    p_{B/F} = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} \left[ \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} \mp \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} \right)^2 \pm \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{n \lambda_{T}^3}{g} \right)^2 \right] = n k_B T \left[ 1 \mp \frac{n_{B/F}}{4\sqrt{2}}\frac{\lambda_{T}^3}{g} \right].
\]
This expression represents the semiclassical expansion of the equation of state for a quantum gas, showing how quantum statistics modify the ideal gas law. The correction term \(\mp \frac{n_{B/F}}{4\sqrt{2}}\frac{\lambda_{T}^3}{g}\) indicates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For bosons (upper sign), the pressure is reduced compared to the classical ideal gas, reflecting the tendency of bosons to cluster together in the same quantum state.
    \item For fermions (lower sign), the pressure is increased due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents multiple fermions from occupying the same quantum state, leading to a higher effective pressure.
    \item These corrections become significant at low temperatures or high densities, where quantum effects dominate the behavior of the gas.
\end{itemize}
We get the idea of quantum gases being \textit{attractive} or \textit{repulsive} depending on their statistics, leading to different macroscopic behaviors compared to classical gases: it is not a real interaction between particles (we are studying free gases) but an effective behavior due to the underlying quantum statistics. Without interactions, bosons still tend to bunch together while fermions repel each other due to the Pauli exclusion principle, but these are statistical effects which manifest in the macroscopic properties of the gas, since they influence how particles distribute themselves among the available quantum states. We have to remember that these corrections are valid only in the semiclassical regime, where quantum effects are present but not dominant, hence the fugacity \(z\) is still much smaller than 1 along with the density \(n\).

Thus the quantum corrections to the classical ideal gas law becomes small when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(g\) is very large (high internal degeneracy): this reduces the effect of quantum statistics by providing more available states for the particles to occupy;\footnote{Fermions cannot occupy the same state, but if we have a very large degeneracy in the energy levels, then we can have a lot of fermions at the same energy, thus mimicking the Bosons behavior.}
    \item the thermal wavelength \(\lambda_{T}\) is very small (high temperature);\footnote{We are speaking of "small" and "large" in relative terms: we intend that \(\lambda_{T}\) is small compared to the Plank constant and other characteristic lengths of the system.}
    \item the particle density \(n\) is very small (low density, again leading to classical statistics).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Fermi-Dirac Gas}

As the temperature decreases towards absolute zero, the fugacity \(z = e^{\beta \mu}\) increases, challenging the validity of simple virial approximations. For Bosons, \(z\) approaches unity from below (\(z \to 1^-\)), pushing the expansion to the edge of its radius of convergence. For Fermions, \(z\) can diverge to infinity (\(z\gg 1\)), exceeding the radius of convergence of standard power series. Consequently, we cannot truncate the expansion at the first few terms; we must instead rely on the full definitions of the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein functions:
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        f_{\nu}(z) & = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{l} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}} \quad \text{(Fermions)}, \\
        g_{\nu}(z) & = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}} \quad \text{(Bosons)}.
    \end{aligned}
\]
While the Bosonic series \(g_{\nu}(z)\) remains valid up to \(z=1\), the Fermionic series \(f_{\nu}(z)\) is only convergent for \(|z| \le 1\), requiring analytical continuation (such as the Sommerfeld expansion) in the degenerate regime.

\paragraph{Absolute convergence.}
We can study the absolute convergence of the series expansion (for both the Bose-Einstein functions $g_\nu(z)$ and the Fermi-Dirac functions $f_\nu(z)$) by considering the sum of the absolute values of its terms. Since the alternating sign $(\pm 1)^l$ vanishes inside the modulus, we obtain:
\[
    \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \left\vert (\pm 1)^{l}\frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}} \right\vert = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{\vert z \vert^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}}.
\]
Applying the standard ratio test,\footnote{The standard ratio test consists in taking the limit of the absolute value of the fraction \(a_{n+1}/a_n\), and then checking if this limit is less than 1 for convergence.} this series converges absolutely if and only if:
\[
    \lim_{l \to \infty} \left| \frac{z^{l+2}}{z^{l+1}} \left(\frac{l+1}{l+2}\right)^{\nu} \right| \sim \vert z \vert < 1.
\]
While for Bosons this series is always convergent (they always satisfy $\vert z \vert < 1$, since $\mu \le 0$), for Fermions the fugacity \(z\) can take any positive value, including values greater than 1 when the chemical potential \(\mu\) is positive. Therefore, we have absolute convergence only for \(\vert z \vert < 1\). For \(z > 1\), the series may or may not be \textit{simply convergent},\footnote{Simple convergence (also known as \textit{pointwise convergence}) means that the sequence of functions converges to a limit for each fixed point $x$ individually, but the rate of convergence may vary depending on $x$.} and it can be necessary to evaluate the functions \(f_{\nu}(z)\) using the integral representation (analytic continuation) rather than this power series. Usually, for fermions at very low temperatures, the \textit{Sommerfeld expanson} is used to approximate these functions for large \(z\) (as an asymptotic technique used to approximate integrals involving the Fermi-Dirac distribution by expanding in powers of the temperature \(T\)), but this is beyond the scope of this course.

Thus, for fermions in the classical regime the series converges absolutely for all physically relevant values of \(z\), while the problem of convergence arises only in the degenerate regime at low temperatures when \(z\) becomes large.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.45\textwidth}
        \caption{Plot of the Fermi-Dirac power series \(f_{\nu}(z)\) for different values of \(\nu\) in the classical limit. If the series is well defined and convergent for all \(z \geq 0\), then it is positive, continuous and monotonically increasing. For \(z\) near 0 the series assumes a linear behavior, while for large \(z\) it grows more slowly.}
        \label{fig:figure-fermi-dirac-series}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

We are looking at the limit for small temperatures \(T \to 0\), such that \(\beta \to \infty\) and thus \(z = e^{\beta \mu} \to \infty\) if \(\mu > 0\): recalling the integral expressions for the particle density and energy density (since they are valid for all temperatures in general)\footnote{Remember for the following computation that the discrete internal degeneracy is included in \(A\) or \(g(\epsilon)\).}
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n  = \frac{N}{V}       & = A \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \epsilon^{1/2} \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\epsilon-\mu)} + 1} = \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon}g(\epsilon)\langle n(\epsilon) \rangle^{FD}_{gc},               \\
        \epsilon = \frac{E}{V} & = A \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \epsilon^{3/2} \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\epsilon-\mu)} + 1} = \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \epsilon \, g(\epsilon) \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle^{FD}_{gc},
    \end{aligned}
\]
where it is crucial to know that the \textit{density of states} \(g(\epsilon)\) has unique definitions valid for the system under consideration (remember we are in the non-relativistic 3D quantum gas setting).
Now it is of maximum interest to understand how \(\langle n(\epsilon) \rangle^{FD}_{gc}\) behaves in this limit: plotting the function for \(\beta \to \infty\), and we find that it behaves as a \textit{Heaviside step function}
\[
    \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle^{FD}_{gc} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\epsilon - \mu)} + 1} \xrightarrow{\beta \to \infty} \begin{dcases}
        1,   & \epsilon < \mu; \\
        1/2, & \epsilon = \mu; \\
        0,   & \epsilon > \mu.
    \end{dcases}
\]
This is the famous \textbf{Fermi-Dirac distribution at zero temperature}, which shows that all states with energy below the chemical potential \(\mu\) are fully occupied, while those above \(\mu\) are empty. The chemical potential at zero temperature is known as the \textbf{Fermi energy} \(\epsilon_F\), which defines the highest occupied energy level in the system at absolute zero.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/FD_distribution_0K.png}

    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.45\textwidth}
        \caption{Plot of the Fermi-Dirac distribution at zero temperature, which resembles a Heaviside step function. All states with energy below the chemical potential \(\mu\) (the Fermi energy \(\epsilon_F\)) are fully occupied, while those above are empty; while we let \(T\) increase the step function smooths out as thermal excitations allow some particles to occupy higher energy states.}
        \label{fig:figure-fermi-dirac-zero-temp}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Thus, we can compute the integrals for \(n\) and \(\epsilon\) at zero temperature as
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n        & = \int_0^{\mu=\epsilon_F} g(\epsilon) \cdot 1 \, \mathrm{d} \epsilon = A \int_0^{\epsilon_F} \epsilon^{1/2} \mathrm{d} \epsilon = \frac{2}{3} A \epsilon_F^{3/2},                                                                   \\
        \epsilon & = \frac{1}{n} \int_0^{\mu=\epsilon_F} g(\epsilon) \epsilon \cdot 1 \, \mathrm{d} \epsilon = \frac{A}{n} \int_0^{\epsilon_F} \epsilon^{3/2} \mathrm{d} \epsilon = \frac{2}{5} \frac{A}{n} \epsilon_F^{5/2} = \frac{3}{5} \epsilon_F.
    \end{aligned}
\]
We can also find an explicit expression for the Fermi energy \(\epsilon_F\) in terms of the particle density \(n\):
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_F = \left( \frac{3n}{2A} \right)^{2/3},
    \label{eq:fermi_energy}
\end{equation}
so that we can control the behavior of the system at zero temperature acting on the density of particles.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.60\textwidth}

        \caption{Occupation of energy levels by electrons in a metal at zero temperature, illustrating the filling up to the Fermi energy \(\epsilon_F\). As temperature increases, electrons can be thermally excited to higher energy states above \(\epsilon_F\).}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
We can study how metals behave under these conditions, since the conduction electrons in metals can be modeled as a Fermi gas. At low temperatures, the electrons fill up energy levels up to the Fermi energy, leading to unique electronic properties, such as electrical conductivity and heat capacity, which differ significantly from classical predictions. We can dope the metal to change the electron density \(n\), which in turn modifies the Fermi energy \(\epsilon_F\) and thus the electronic properties of the material.

        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/Semiconductor_Fermi_Level_Band_Diagram.jpg}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

We can also compute the grand potential \(\Omega_F\) at zero temperature using the relation \(\Omega_F = - \frac{2}{3} E_F\) with the intent to find the pressure of the Fermi gas at absolute zero:
\[
    \Omega_F = - \frac{2}{3} E = - pV, \quad p = \frac{2}{3} \frac{E}{V} = \frac{2}{3} n \epsilon = \frac{2}{3} n \left(\frac{3}{5} \epsilon_F\right) = \frac{2}{5} n \epsilon_F > 0.
\]
For any perfect classical gas we have a zero pressure at zero temperature, while here we have a finite pressure due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents all fermions from occupying the lowest energy state. This leads to a degeneracy pressure that supports the system against collapse, which is particularly important in astrophysical contexts such as white dwarf stars: the electron degeneracy pressure arising from the Fermi gas of electrons counteracts gravitational collapse, stabilizing the star.

With an augment in temperature, the sharp occupation of energy levels at the Fermi energy smooths out, leading to thermal excitations around \(k_B T\) of electrons near the Fermi level, affecting the electronic properties of the material. It is thus really useful to define a Fermi temperature \(T_F\) associated to the Fermi energy:
\[
    k_B T_F = \epsilon_F \implies T_F = \frac{\epsilon_F}{k_B},
\]
which provides a temperature scale below which quantum effects become significant for the fermi gas. At temperatures much lower than \(T_F\), the gas exhibits quantum behavior, with non negligible behaviours due to statistical properties, while at temperatures much higher than \(T_F\), it behaves more classically
\[
    T_F = \frac{1}{k_B}\left(\frac{6\pi^2}{g}\right)^{2/3}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}n^{2/3}.
\]
This fact is not arbitrary: it comes from the comparison between the thermal energy \(k_B T\) and the Fermi energy \(\epsilon_F\), in the denominator of the Fermi-Dirac distribution. When \(k_B T \ll \epsilon_F\), the thermal excitations are small compared to the energy scale set by the Fermi energy, leading to quantum behavior. Conversely, when \(k_B T \gg \epsilon_F\), thermal excitations dominate, and the gas behaves more classically (i.e. the occupation of energy levels follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution):
\[
    \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\epsilon - \mu)} + 1} \xrightarrow{k_B T \gg \epsilon_F} e^{-\beta(\epsilon - \mu)},
\]
considering \(\epsilon\) near the Fermi energy.

We can derive an approximate value for a metal with \(n \sim 10^{22 / 23} \text{ electron}/\text{cm}^3\), \(g=2\) (for spin degeneracy) and \(m\) equal to the electron mass:
\[
    T_F \sim 10^{4-5} K,
\]
so that at room temperature (\(\sim 300 K\)) the electron gas in metals can be treated as a degenerate Fermi gas, with quantum effects dominating its behavior.
For stars like white dwarfs, where the electron density is extremely high (\(n \sim 10^{30} \text{ electron}/\text{cm}^3\)), the Fermi temperature can reach values on the order of \(10^{11} K\) or higher (where the star temperature is much lower, around \(10^7\) Kelvin), indicating that the electron gas remains degenerate even at very high temperatures.

\section{Bose-Einstein Gas}

We can now analyze the behavior of a Bose gas at low temperatures, where quantum effects become significant and lead to phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation. Starting from the expressions for the particle density and the pressure:
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        n & = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} g_{3/2}(z),       \\
        p & = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} g_{5/2}(z),
    \end{aligned}
\]
where again we have defined the Bose-Einstein functions \(g_{\nu}(z)\) as a power series in the fugacity \(z\):
\[
    g_{\nu}(z) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}}.
\]
We can study the behavior of these functions as \(z\) approaches 1 (low temperatures) and as \(z\) is very small compared to 1 (high temperatures). These are the two regimes of interest for the Bose gas: the quantum degenerate regime and the classical limit. We already discussed the classical and semiclassical limit in \ref{sec:classical_limit_quantum_gas}, thus we will now focus on the quantum degenerate regime where characteristic effects of bosons emerge.

To analyze the behavior of the \textbf{Bose gas in the quantum degenerate regime}, we need to consider the full power series expansion for the Bose-Einstein functions \(g_{\nu}(z)\): we need to check convergence of the series as \(z\) approaches 1 (low temperatures). The series converges for all \(z < 1\), but as \(z\) approaches 1, the terms in the series become larger and larger, leading to a divergence at \(z = 1\): we cannot simply truncate the series at a finite number of terms, as we did in the classical limit.

We will consider both the particle density and pressure expressions, so we need the series expansion for both \(g_{3/2}(z)\) and \(g_{5/2}(z)\). Starting from the general expression
\[
    g_{\nu}(z) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{\nu}},
\]
we have to analyze \(\nu=3/2\) and \(\nu=5/2\):\TODO{insert plot of g-nu(z) for nu=3/2 and 5/2.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For \(\nu = 3/2\):
          \[
              g_{3/2}(z) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{3/2}}.
          \]
          As \(z\) approaches 1, the series diverges, indicating that the particle density \(n\) also diverges. In particular
          \begin{itemize}
              \item For \(\vert z \vert < 1\), the series is \textbf{absolutely convergent};
              \item For \(\vert z \vert = 1\), the series is \textbf{simply convergent};
              \item For \(\vert z \vert > 1\), the series is \textbf{divergent}.
          \end{itemize}
          These properties should not surprise us, since bosons can have \(\mu(T) \leq 0\) and thus \(z \leq 1\): the only physically relevant case is the first one, where the series converges absolutely.
    \item For \(\nu = 5/2\):
          \[
              g_{5/2}(z) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{l+1}}{(l+1)^{5/2}}.
          \]
          Similar considerations apply here: as \(z\) approaches 1, the series diverges, indicating that the pressure \(p\) also diverges. The series diverges as \(\vert z \vert\) grows, but it is defined for all values of the fugacity, even for \(\vert z \vert > 1\).
\end{enumerate}

We now intend to study the dependence of the \textbf{chemical potential} \(\mu\) on the temperature \(T\) in this quantum degenerate regime.
\begin{itemize}
    \item At high temperatures, in the classical limit, \(\mu \to -\infty\) as \(T \to \infty\), leading to \(z \ll 1\).
    \item As the temperature decreases, \(\mu \to 0^{-}\), leading to an increase in the fugacity \(z\) towards 1.
    \item The chemical potential is a monotonically decreasing function of temperature
          \[
              \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial T} \leq 0,
          \]
          approaching 0 from below as \(T\) approaches a critical temperature \(T_c\); this is true because a thermodynamic potential is expressed like that and verifies this property.
\end{itemize}
\TODO{insert plot of mu vs T for Bose gas.}
Thus we can define the critical temperature \(T_c\) for Bose-Einstein condensation as the temperature at which the chemical potential \(\mu\) reaches 0, leading to \(z = 1\); there are two possible cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(T_c = 0\) so that \(\mu(T_c)=0\) \(\implies\) we are in the \(2D\)-Bose gas case, where no condensation occurs at finite temperature (we will show this later in the exercises, as well as the case of \(2D\) Bose gas trapped in a harmonic potential, which instead shows condensation at finite temperature);
    \item \(T_c \neq 0\) so that \(\mu(T_c)=0\) \(\implies\) we are in the \(3D\)-Bose gas case, where condensation occurs at a finite temperature (below \(T_c\)).
\end{itemize}
Setting our analysis in the \(3D\) case, we can find an expression for the critical temperature \(T_c\) by setting \(\mu = 0\) (thus \(z=1\)) in the expression for the particle density:
\[
    n = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T_c}^3} g_{3/2}(1) = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T_c}^3} \zeta(3/2),
\]
where we have used the Riemann zeta function \(\zeta(\nu) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(l+1)^{\nu}}=g_{\nu}(1)\) to express \(g_{3/2}(1)\). Solving for \(T_c\), we find
\[
    T_{BEC} = \frac{2 \pi \hbar^2}{m k_B} \left( \frac{n}{g \zeta(3/2)} \right)^{2/3}.
\]
This expression shows that the critical temperature for \textbf{Bose-Einstein condensation} depends on the particle density \(n\), the mass of the bosons \(m\), and the internal degeneracy \(g\).

\subsection{Bose-Einstein Condensation}

Below this critical temperature, a macroscopic number of bosons occupy the ground state, leading to the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation, which has been observed experimentally in systems such as ultracold atomic gases. This happens at temperatures comprised in the range of nanoKelvins to microKelvins, since the chemical potential remains equal to zero in this whole range of temperatures below \(T_{BEC}\).

So the occupation number for temperatures below \(T_{BEC}\) can be expressed as
\[
    n(T<T_{BEC}) = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \zeta(3/2).
\]
We have to pay attention reading the consequences of this result: as temperature decreases below \(T_{BEC}\) and approaches absolute zero, \(\lambda_T = \left(\frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{m k_B T}\right)^{1/2}\xrightarrow{T \to 0} \infty\) diverges, leading to a decrease in the particle density \(n\) until the absolute zero is reached:
\[
    n \xrightarrow{\lambda_T \to \infty} 0.
\]
Particles cannot disappear as temperature decreases, so we have to conclude that the expression for the particle density above only accounts for particles in excited states (with \(\epsilon > 0\)), while a macroscopic number of particles condense into the ground state (with \(\epsilon = 0\)). If we consider, indeed, the number of particles in the ground state for \(\epsilon = 0\), we can write
\[
    \langle n_0 \rangle_{gc}^{B} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta(0 - \mu)} - 1} = \frac{1}{e^{-\beta \mu} - 1} = \frac{z}{1 - z} \xrightarrow{z \to 1} \infty,
\]
indicating that as \(\mu\) approaches 0 (i.e., as \(z\) approaches 1), the occupation number of the ground state diverges, leading to a macroscopic occupation of this state. But we can be more precise: the total number of particles \(N\) in the system can be fixed, so it cannot diverge statistically; we can express it as the sum of particles in the ground state \(N_0\) and particles in excited states \(N_{exc}\): starting again from the number of states in the momentum space
\[
    N = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} n(\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}), \quad \epsilon_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}}{2m}, \quad \mathbf{k} = \frac{2\pi}{L} (n_x,\, n_y,\, n_z),
\]
if we compute the TD limit the number of particles becomes
\[
    N = \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle_{gc}^{B} = N_0 + \int_{\epsilon > 0} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle_{gc}^{B} = N_0 + N_{exc}.
\]
This is the crucial point: since \(\langle n(0) \rangle_{gc}^{B}\Big\vert_{\mu=0} \to \infty\) we formally need to separate the contribution of the ground state (with \(\epsilon = 0\)) from the contributions of all excited states (with \(\epsilon > 0\)), even if the integral over all energies wasn't seeing the divergence: it is only one point and computing the integral does not capture the divergence. Thus, we can express the number of particles as
\[
    N = N_0 + \sum_{\mathbf{k}} N_{\epsilon_\mathbf{k}},
\]
\(N_0\) being the number of particles in the ground state, and the sum being over all excited states. In the TD limit, the number of particles divided by the volume becomes\footnote{Where the integral is again computed over all values of \(\epsilon\), since the ground state contribution has already been separated out formally and, as we said, the integral does not see the divergence practically.}
\[
    n = n_0(T) + \frac{1}{V} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle_{gc}^{B},
\]
an equivalently, after substituting the expression for the density of states and the Bose-Einstein distribution, we find
\begin{equation}
    n = n_0(T) + \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} g_{3/2}(z) = n_0(T) + n_n(T).
    \label{eq:BE_density_split}
\end{equation}
since we call the number of particles in excited states \(n_{n}(T)\), the "\textbf{normal}" component of the gas. If we now take the limit \(\mu \to 0\) (thus \(z \to 1\)) we find
\[
    n = n_0(T) + \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \zeta(3/2),
\]
where \(\zeta(3/2)\) is the Riemann zeta function, equal to \(g_{3/2}(1)\). We can derive \(\zeta(3/2)\) by computing \(n(T_{BEC})\): at the critical temperature \(T_{BEC}\) we can assume \(n_0 = 0\), since condensation is just starting, so that
\[
    n = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T_{BEC}}^3} \zeta(3/2) \implies \zeta(3/2) = \frac{n \lambda_{T_{BEC}}^3}{g}.
\]
If we compute the normal density for temperatures below \(T_{BEC}\), the number of particles in excited states is given by
\begin{equation}
    n_{n}(T < T_{BEC}) = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \zeta(3/2) = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \frac{n \lambda_{T_{BEC}}^3}{g} = n \left( \frac{T}{T_{BEC}} \right)^{3/2},
    \label{eq:BEC_normal_density}
\end{equation}
indicating that not all particles can be accommodated in excited states. We have made no assumptions on the nature and behaviour of \(n_0(T)\), but now that particle are disappearing from the exited states (\(\tfrac{T}{T_{BEC}}<1\)), we are lead to believe that a macroscopic occupation of the ground state is happening, so that the number of particles in the ground state becomes:
\begin{equation}
    n_0 = n - n_{n} = n \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T}{T_{BEC}} \right)^{3/2} \right].
    \label{eq:BEC_ground_density}
\end{equation}
This expression shows that as the temperature decreases below \(T_{BEC}\), the number of particles in the ground state \(N_0\) increases, reaching a maximum of \(N\) at absolute zero. This phenomenon is the hallmark of Bose-Einstein condensation, where a significant fraction of bosons occupy the lowest energy state, leading to unique macroscopic quantum phenomena such as superfluidity and coherence.

\subsubsection{Bose-Einstein Condensation as a Phase Transition}

Thus our refined expression for the density of particles in a Bose gas becomes
\[
    n = n_0(T) + n_{n}(T).
\]
Now we can compute the two components separately for the two regimes of temperature:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \(T \geq T_{BEC}\), there is no condensation, so all particles are in excited states:
          \[
              T \geq T_{BEC} \begin{dcases}
                  n_0(T)   & = 0,                                         \\
                  n_{n}(T) & = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} g_{3/2}(z) = n(T).
              \end{dcases}
          \]
          In particular, when \(T = T_{BEC}\), we have \(z = 1\) and thus
          \[
              n_{n}(T_{BEC}) = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T_{BEC}}^3} \zeta(3/2) = n(T_{BEC}).
          \]
    \item For \(T < T_{BEC}\), condensation occurs, so we have a macroscopic occupation of the ground state:
          \[
              T < T_{BEC} \begin{dcases}
                  n_0(T)   & = n \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T}{T_{BEC}} \right)^{3/2} \right],                   \\
                  n_{n}(T) & = \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \zeta(3/2) = n \left( \frac{T}{T_{BEC}} \right)^{3/2}.
              \end{dcases}
          \]
\end{itemize}
Thus we can consider \(n_0(T)\) as an order parameter for the \textbf{Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition}, which is zero above \(T_{BEC}\) and non-zero below it, indicating the onset of macroscopic quantum coherence in the system. There will be a SSB of the gauge symmetry associated to the phase of the condensate wavefunction, leading to unique physical properties such as superfluidity and coherence.

    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.45\textwidth}
        \caption{Order parameter \(n_0(T)/n\) for the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition as a function of temperature \(T\). The order parameter is zero above the critical temperature \(T_{BEC}\) and increases as the temperature decreases below \(T_{BEC}\), indicating the onset of macroscopic occupation of the ground state.}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

We will learn more about the implications of this phase transition by studying the thermodynamical quantities of the Bose gas in the two temperature regimes.

\begin{remark}
    We will see in the next few sections that this phase transition has somehow its own thermodynamical signatures, as discontinuities in the specific heat and other thermodynamic quantities at the critical temperature \(T_{BEC}\) which are not solely riconducible to one specific order of PT. This phase transition is a purely quantum mechanical effect, arising from the indistinguishability and bosonic nature of the particles, and has no classical counterpart since no interactions are needed.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Thermodynamical Quantities}

Now we can compute the pressure of the Bose gas and relate it to the energy through the grand potential \(\Omega_B\). Recalling the expression for the pressure
\[
    p = \frac{g}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} g_{5/2}(z),
\]
and since the grand potential is related to the pressure by \(\Omega = - pV\) and to the energy by \(\Omega = - \frac{2}{3} E\), we can write
\[
    E = \frac{3}{2} pV = \frac{3}{2} \frac{gV}{\beta \lambda_{T}^3} g_{5/2}(z).
\]
Notably, the energy expression does not explicitly depend on the condensate fraction \(n_0(T)\), since the ground state does not contribute to the energy in this idealized model. The energy is determined solely by the particles in excited states, which follow the Bose-Einstein distribution.

We can now compute the energy per particle \(E/N\) in the two temperature regimes, considering that the total number of particles contribuiting to the energy \(N_n\) is
\[
    n_n = \frac{N_n}{V} = \begin{dcases}
        \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} g_{3/2}(z) = n, \quad                                      & T > T_{BEC}, \\
        \frac{g}{\lambda_{T}^3} \zeta(3/2) = n \left(\frac{T}{T_{BEC}}\right)^{3/2}, \quad & T < T_{BEC}.
    \end{dcases}
\]
Thus we have
\begin{equation}
    u = \frac{E}{N_n} = \begin{dcases}
        \frac{3}{2} k_B T \frac{g_{5/2}(z)}{g_{3/2}(z)}, \quad & T > T_{BEC}, \\
        \frac{3}{2} k_B T \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)}, \quad & T < T_{BEC}.
    \end{dcases}
    \label{eq:BEC_energy_per_particle}
\end{equation}
Note that we have used the expression for the normal component \(n_{n}(T)\) to relate the energy to the total number of particles \(N\): only the normal component contributes to the energy and we are computing the expression for \(u=\frac{E}{V}\frac{V}{N}\) accordingly. If we were instead interested in the energy per total number of particles \(E/N\), which takes into account the condensate fraction, we would have to divide the energy \(E\) by the total number of particles \(N\), leading to
\begin{equation}
    u = \frac{E}{N} = \begin{dcases}
        \frac{3}{2} k_B T \frac{g_{5/2}(z)}{g_{3/2}(z)}, \quad                                      & T > T_{BEC}, \\
        \frac{3}{2} k_B T \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)} \left(\frac{T}{T_{BEC}}\right)^{3/2}, \quad & T < T_{BEC},
    \end{dcases}
    \label{eq:BEC_energy_per_particle_total}
\end{equation}
which shows that the energy per total number of particles decreases more rapidly below \(T_{BEC}\) due to the increasing occupation of the ground state, not contributing to the energy. We should also note that at the critical temperature \(T = T_{BEC}\), the energy per particle is continuous:
\[
    u\Big\vert_{T=T_{BEC}} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T_{BEC} \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)},
\]
since \(g_{5/2}(1) = \zeta(5/2)\) and \(g_{3/2}(1) = \zeta(3/2)\). Thus the energy per particle does not exhibit a discontinuity at the critical temperature, indicating that the Bose-Einstein condensation transition is a continuous phase transition in terms of energy.

If we consider the expression for the specific heat at constant volume \(c_V\), we can derive it from the energy expression by differentiating with respect to temperature to find a typical II order PT discontinuity:\footnote{Since \(C_V\) is already a first derivative of a thermodynamical quantity, the energy: II order PT are characterzed by discontinuities at second or higher derivatives (as here we found the discontinuity in the derivative of the first derivative of the energy).}
\[
    c_V = \frac{C_V}{N} = \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial T} \right)_V.
\]
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.50\textwidth}
        Calculating \(c_V\) in the two temperature regimes, we find that it exhibits a discontinuity at the critical temperature \(T_{BEC}\), characteristic of a second-order phase transition, and it goes to zero as \(T\) approaches absolute zero, in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics (fixing the problem we had with the classical ideal gas).
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/BEC_Cv.png}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Finally, the \textbf{entropy} \(S\) of the Bose gas can be computed using the thermodynamic relation
\[
    S = \frac{E - \Omega - \mu N}{T}.
\]
So we can compute the three terms separately:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The energy \(E\) is given by the expressions derived above for the two temperature regimes.
    \item The grand potential \(\Omega\) is related to the energy by \(\Omega = - (2/3)E\), with \(E\) given by the previous expression.
    \item The chemical potential \(\mu\) is zero for \(T < T_{BEC}\) and negative for \(T > T_{BEC}\), approaching zero from below as \(T\) approaches \(T_{BEC}\) from above, while \(N\) is the total number of particles in the system.
\end{itemize}
Substituting these expressions into the entropy formula, we can derive
\[
    S = \begin{dcases}
        \frac{gV}{\lambda_T^3} k_B \left( \frac{5}{2} g_{5/2}(z) - g_{3/2}(z) \log z \right), \quad & T > T_{BEC}, \\
        \frac{gV}{\lambda_{T}^3} k_B \frac{5}{2} \zeta(5/2), \quad                                  & T < T_{BEC}.
    \end{dcases}
\]
Now the entropy per particle \(S/N_n = s\) can be computed in both temperature regimes, revealing how the entropy behaves across the Bose-Einstein condensation transition:
\[
    s = \frac{S}{N_n} = \begin{dcases}
        \frac{5}{2} k_B \frac{g_{5/2}(z)}{g_{3/2}(z)} - k_B \log z, \quad & T > T_{BEC}, \\
        \frac{5}{2} k_B \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)}, \quad              & T < T_{BEC}.
    \end{dcases}
\]
Here we have used the expression for the normal component \(N_n\) to relate the entropy to the total number of particles \(N\), since we know \(s(0)=0\) for the condensate component.

We can also compute the entropy per particle precisely at the critical temperature \(T = T_{BEC}\):
\[
    s\Big\vert_{T=T_{BEC}} = \frac{5}{2} k_B \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)},
\]
while at the critic temperature we have zero particles in the ground state, so all particles contribute to the entropy. As temperature decreases below \(T_{BEC}\), the entropy \(S(T<T_c)\) decreases due to the increasing occupation of the ground state, in which particles stop to contribute to the system entropy,\footnote{We would have not noticed this behaviour from the expression of the entropy per particle, which shows only the contribution of the normal component.} reflecting the onset of macroscopic quantum coherence in the system. If we compute the entropy change per particle at the transition temperature:
\[
    q = T_{BEC} \Delta s = T_{BEC} \left[s(T_{BEC}) - s(0)\right] = \frac{5}{2} k_B T_{BEC} \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)} \neq 0,
\]
since \(s(0)=0\); this indicates a \textit{finite entropy change} at the transition temperature \(T_{BEC}\) with non zero \textbf{latent heat}, characteristic of a first-order phase transition.

Usually PT are induced by interactions among particles, while here we have a PT in an ideal gas: this is possible because of the SSB of the gauge symmetry associated to the phase of the condensate wavefunction, which leads to a new ordered phase with lower entropy. This is a peculiar feature of Bose-Einstein condensation, where the transition is driven by quantum statistics rather than interactions. It is a strange PT indeed, since we have a \textbf{specific heat discontinuity}\footnote{\(C_V\) is already a first derivative and the discontinuity is found in its derivative: it is a discontinuity in second derivatives of TD potentials, typical of a continuous PT.} at \(T_{BEC}\) (typical of second-order PT), but we also have a \textbf{finite entropy change} at the transition (typical of first-order PT). This is a unique characteristic of the Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon.

\subsection{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in BE Condensation}

The hamiltonian of a non-interacting Bose gas is invariant under a global \(U(1)\) gauge transformation, which corresponds to multiplying the bosonic field operators by a phase factor \(e^{i\theta}\):
\[
    \hat{\psi}(\mathbf{r}) \to e^{i\theta} \hat{\psi}(\mathbf{r}), \quad \hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{r}) \to e^{-i\theta} \hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{r}).
\]
This symmetry reflects the conservation of particle number in the system, since it is originated from the number operator \(\hat{N} = \sum_{\mathbf{k}}  \hat{a}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{k}) \hat{a}(\mathbf{k})\).
\[
    U(\theta) = e^{i \theta \hat{N}} \implies \begin{dcases}
        U^{\dagger}(\theta) \hat{a}(\mathbf{k}) U(\theta) = e^{i\theta} \hat{a}(\mathbf{k}), \\
        U^{\dagger}(\theta) \hat{a}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{k}) U(\theta) = e^{-i\theta} \hat{a}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{k}),
    \end{dcases}
\]
passing from the infinitesimal transformation \(U(\theta) \sim \mathbb{I} + i\theta \hat{N} + O(\theta^2)\).
When Bose-Einstein condensation occurs below the critical temperature \(T_{BEC}\), a macroscopic number of bosons occupy the ground state, where
\[
    n_0 = \langle \hat{a}_0^{\dagger} \hat{a}_0 \rangle = \langle \hat{a}_0^{\dagger} \rangle \langle \hat{a}_0 \rangle \begin{dcases}
        = 0,    & \text{ if } T>T_{BEC} \text{ since } \langle \hat{a}_0 \rangle = 0;     \\
        \neq 0, & \text{ if }  T<T_{BEC} \text{ since } \langle \hat{a}_0 \rangle \neq 0.
    \end{dcases}
\]
This non-zero expectation value of the annihilation operator \(\hat{a}_0\) under the critical temperature indicates that the ground state has a well-defined phase, breaking the global \(U(1)\) gauge symmetry of the hamiltonian. We know that \(N_{\mathbf{k}}\) is invariant, since
\[
    N^{\prime}_{\mathbf{k}} = \hat{a}^{\prime \dagger}(\mathbf{k}) \hat{a}^{\prime}(\mathbf{k}) = e^{-i\theta} \hat{a}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{k}) e^{i\theta} \hat{a}(\mathbf{k}) = \hat{a}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{k}) \hat{a}(\mathbf{k}) = N_{\mathbf{k}},
\]
but, as we have seen, this is not valid for the ground state below \(T_{BEC}\), where \(\langle \hat{a}_0 \rangle \neq 0\). Thus the system chooses a specific phase for the condensate wavefunction, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). This SSB has profound implications for the physical properties of the Bose-Einstein condensate, including effects of quntum coherence.

\section{Fenomenology of BEC and Experimental Realizations}

We are going to discuss some further details on Bose-Einstein condensation, including its physical interpretation, experimental realizations, and implications for quantum coherence and superfluidity.
For starter we have to distinguidh two regimes from the scale lengths involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{microscopic scale}, characterized by the thermal wavelength \(\lambda_T\), which represents the typical de Broglie wavelength of particles at temperature \(T\):
          \[
              \lambda_T = \left( \frac{2\pi \hbar^2}{m k_B T} \right)^{1/2}.
          \]
          At low temperatures, \(\lambda_T\) becomes large, indicating that quantum effects become significant and particles exhibit wave-like behavior.
    \item The \textbf{macroscopic scale}, characterized by the interparticle distance \(d\), which represents the average distance between particles in the gas:
          \[
              d = n^{-1/3},
          \]
          where \(n\) is the particle density.
          At high temperatures, the wavelength \(\lambda_T\) is much smaller than the interparticle distance \(d\), indicating that particles behave classically and their wavefunctions are localized (like narrow deltas in space).
\end{itemize}
When the temperature decreases, \(\lambda_T\) increases and can become comparable to or larger than \(d\), leading to significant overlap of particle wavefunctions and the emergence of quantum coherence. This is the regime where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs, as particles can occupy the same quantum state and form a macroscopic condensate.

\end{table}

\begin{example}[Superfluidity in liquid helium-4]
    In 1938, Allen and Misener, and independently Kapitza, discovered that liquid helium-4 exhibits superfluidity below a critical temperature of approximately \(T_c \sim \SI{2.17}{\kelvin}\). This phenomenon is characterized by the ability of the liquid to flow without viscosity, allowing it to pass through narrow channels and over obstacles without resistance. We briefly discussed it in the PT chapter (phase diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:phase_diag_4He}).

    If we were to measure the specific heat capacity of liquid helium-4 as a function of temperature, we would observe a sharp peak at the critical temperature \(T_c\), known as the lambda point due to its characteristic shape. This peak indicates a superfluid phase transition, where the system undergoes a change in its thermodynamic properties. Below \(T_c\), the specific heat capacity decreases, reflecting the reduced number of available excitations in the superfluid phase.

    The superfluidity of liquid helium-4 cannot be fully explained by the ideal Bose gas model, as interactions between helium atoms in the liquid phase (at that temperature helium is liquid) play a crucial role in the emergence of superfluid behavior; we would need a really rarefied gas of helium-4 atoms to observe BEC directly. Furthermore we see a divergence in the specific heat, which was not predicted by the ideal Bose gas model.

    In experiments with ultracold atomic gases, researchers have successfully created Bose-Einstein condensates of helium-4 atoms by cooling them to temperatures on the order of nanokelvins, allowing for the direct observation of BEC phenomena.

\begin{example}[BEC in ultracold atomic gases]
    In 1995, Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at JILA (University of Colorado) and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT successfully created Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in ultracold atomic gases, marking a significant milestone in experimental physics. They used laser cooling and evaporative cooling techniques to cool a dilute gas of Rubidium-87 atoms (Cornell and Wieman) and Sodium-23 atoms (Ketterle) to temperatures on the order of nanokelvins (\(T_{BEC} \sim \SI{10}{\nano\kelvin} - \SI{1}{\micro\kelvin}\) ), allowing the atoms to occupy the same quantum state and form a macroscopic condensate (see Fig. \ref{fig:BEC_atomic_clouds}).

    The mathematical description of BEC was achieved completely around 1924-25 by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, but it took about 70 years to realize it experimentally due to the extreme conditions required to achieve such low temperatures and high densities. The experimental realization of BEC in ultracold atomic gases provided a platform for studying quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale, leading to insights into superfluidity, quantum coherence, and many-body physics.
\end{example}

\subsection{How to Reach NanoKelvins?}
Achieving temperatures in the nanokelvin range requires sophisticated cooling techniques that go beyond traditional methods. Here are some of the key techniques used to reach such ultra-low temperatures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Laser cooling}: This technique uses the momentum of photons to slow down and cool atoms. By tuning the frequency of laser light slightly below an atomic transition, atoms moving towards the laser absorb photons and experience a recoil that slows them down. This process, known as Doppler cooling, can bring atomic gases down to microkelvin temperatures.

          We would need to use multiple laser beams arranged in a configuration known as \textit{optical molasses} to achieve effective cooling in three dimensions. The atoms are trapped in a region where the laser beams intersect, allowing for efficient cooling.

          This technique is often the first step in cooling atoms before applying more advanced methods to reach even lower temperatures, since it would likely reach only \textbf{microkelvin temperatures}.

    \item \textbf{Magnetic evaporation}: This technique involves trapping atoms in a magnetic field and selectively removing the most energetic atoms from the trap. By gradually lowering the depth of the magnetic trap, the hottest atoms escape, leaving behind a colder sample (like evaporation at room temperature with a cup of coffee). This process can be repeated multiple times, lowering further and further the magnetic trap depth to achieve temperatures in the \textbf{nanokelvin range}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to Observe BEC?}

When we are at high temperatures, the atomic cloud behaves like a classical gas, with atoms moving randomly and independently, as localized particles with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities. As we cool the gas down to temperatures near \(T_{BEC}\), we can observe the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation through several experimental signatures:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{img/BEC_atomic_clouds.jpeg}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
        \caption{Atomic clouds of Rubidium-87 at different temperatures, showing the transition from a classical gas to a Bose-Einstein condensate as the temperature decreases below \(T_{BEC}\). The images illustrate the density distribution of the atomic cloud, with a sharp peak forming at the center of the trap as the condensate forms.}
        \label{fig:BEC_atomic_clouds}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Density distribution}: Above \(T_{BEC}\), the density distribution of the atomic cloud is relatively uniform, reflecting the classical behavior of the gas. As we approach \(T_{BEC}\), a sharp peak in the density distribution appears at the center of the trap, indicating the formation of a condensate. Below \(T_{BEC}\), this peak becomes more pronounced, with a significant fraction of atoms occupying the lowest energy state.

    \item \textbf{Momentum distribution}: The momentum distribution of atoms can be measured using time-of-flight imaging. Above \(T_{BEC}\), the momentum distribution is broad and Gaussian-like, characteristic of a thermal gas. As we cool below \(T_{BEC}\), a narrow peak emerges in the momentum distribution, corresponding to the condensate fraction with low momentum: this is a direct signature of macroscopic occupation of the ground state.

    \item \textbf{BEC release}: When the trap confining the atomic cloud is suddenly turned off, the condensate expands differently compared to the thermal component of the gas. The condensate exhibits a characteristic expansion pattern, often referred to as "inverted parabolic" expansion, which can be observed in time-of-flight images. This behavior is distinct from the isotropic expansion of the thermal cloud.
\end{itemize}

But there are other experimental phenomena that can be observed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interference patterns}: When two condensates are allowed to overlap, they can produce interference patterns due to their coherent wavefunctions. This phenomenon is a direct demonstration of the macroscopic quantum coherence of the condensate. We said that the BEC PT is characterized by the SSB of the gauge symmetry associated to the phase of the condensate wavefunction: thus, if we have two condensates with different phases, when they overlap the difference in phase will lead to constructive and destructive interference patterns, which can be observed experimentally.

    \item \textbf{Vortices}: In rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (realised with rotating magnetic fields), quantized vortices can form, which are topological defects characterized by a phase singularity in the condensate wavefunction. The observation of vortices provides evidence of superfluidity in the condensate. Practically we do not have a single classical fluid rotating, but a lattice of quantized vortices localized almost as a grid in the condensate.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cold Atoms in Artificial Lattice}

By using \textbf{optical lattices} created by interfering laser beams, we can simulate periodic potentials for ultracold atoms. This allows us to study phenomena such as the superfluid to Mott insulator transition, where the interplay between kinetic energy and interaction energy leads to different quantum phases. In the superfluid phase, atoms can move freely across the lattice, while in the Mott insulator phase, atoms are localized at individual lattice sites due to strong interactions.

Since the atoms can change minimum energy states by tunneling between lattice sites, we can control the tunneling rate by adjusting the depth of the optical lattice potential. This tunability allows us to explore different regimes of quantum behavior, from weakly interacting superfluids to strongly correlated Mott insulators.

Atoms in optical lattices can also interact with each other through controlled interactions, since they can be made to collide at specific lattice sites. By tuning the interaction strength using Feshbach resonances, we can study the effects of interactions on the quantum phases of the system, leading to rich phase diagrams and novel quantum states.

We can also explore topological phases by engineering specific lattice geometries and interactions. For example, by creating honeycomb or kagome lattices, we can realize systems that exhibit topologically protected edge states and non-trivial band structures. These systems can host exotic quasiparticles such as Majorana fermions and anyons, which have potential applications in quantum computing.

    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
        We could also create lattices in higher dimensions (like \(4D\) lattices) using synthetic dimensions, where internal degrees of freedom of atoms (such as spin states) are treated as additional spatial dimensions. This allows us to explore higher-dimensional physics and topological phenomena that are not accessible in traditional three-dimensional systems: we could simulate quantum gravity models and higher-dimensional topological insulators.
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Photons Gas}

We are going to study now the case of a gas of photons, which are bosons with zero rest mass and two polarization states (thus \(g=2\)); they are ultrarelativistic particles, since they always move at the speed of light \(c\) in vacuum. The energy-momentum relation for photons is given by
\[
    \epsilon{\mathbf{p}} = c\vert \mathbf{p} \vert,
\]
where \(\mathbf{p}\) is the momentum of the photon.

Photons are unique among bosons because they do not have a conserved particle number: they can be created and destroyed freely, for example through absorption and emission processes. This means that the chemical potential \(\mu\) for photons is always zero, leading to a fugacity:
\[
    \mu(T) = 0 \implies z = e^{\beta \mu} = 1, \quad \forall T.
\]

We can now compute the density of states for photons, starting from the general expression for the density of states in three dimensions: from the computation for the volume in phase space we have the cumulative number of states with energy less than or equal to \(\epsilon\):
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \Sigma(\epsilon) & = \int_{0 \leq c\vert \mathbf{p} \vert \leq \epsilon} \d{\Omega} = g \int_{0 \leq c\vert \mathbf{p} \vert \leq \epsilon} \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{x} \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{p}}{h^3} \\
                         & =  2 \int_{0}^{\epsilon / c} \d{p} \frac{V}{h^3} 4\pi p^2 = \frac{V}{(hc)^3} \frac{8\pi}{3} \epsilon^3 = \int_0^{\epsilon} \d{\epsilon'} g(\epsilon'),
    \end{aligned}
\]
since it is a spherical volume in momentum space with radius \(p = \epsilon/c\), and \(g=2\) for the two polarization states of the photon. Differentiating with respect to energy, we find the density of states:
\[
    \omega(\epsilon) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon} \Sigma(\epsilon) = \frac{8 \pi V}{(hc)^3} \epsilon^2 = g(\epsilon).
\]
Using this density of states, we can compute the thermodynamic quantities for the photon gas. The average number of photons \(N\) in the system is given by\footnote{Since the chemical potential is zero, we have \(z=1\) and thus the Bose-Einstein distribution simplifies accordingly.}
\[
    N = \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle_{gc}^{B} = \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \frac{1}{e^{\beta \epsilon} - 1}.
\]
Substituting the expression for the density of states, we have
\[
    N = \frac{8\pi V}{(hc)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \frac{\epsilon^2}{e^{\beta \epsilon} - 1}.
\]
For the energy \(E\) of the photon gas, we have
\[
    E = \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \epsilon \langle n(\epsilon) \rangle_{gc}^{B} = \frac{8\pi V}{(hc)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \frac{\epsilon^3}{e^{\beta \epsilon} - 1}.
\]
For the grand potential \(\Omega\), we have
\[
    \Omega = \frac{1}{\beta} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \log\left( 1 - e^{-\beta \epsilon} \right) = k_B T \frac{8\pi V}{(hc)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \epsilon^2 \log\left( 1 - e^{-\beta \epsilon} \right),
\]
but we can integrate by parts
\[
    \Omega = - \frac{V}{3} \frac{8\pi}{(hc)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \frac{\epsilon^3}{e^{\beta \epsilon} - 1} = - \frac{1}{3} E.
\]
Now the pressure \(p\) of the photon gas is given by
\[
    p = - \frac{\Omega}{V} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{8\pi}{(hc)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \d{\epsilon} \frac{\epsilon^3}{e^{\beta \epsilon} - 1},
\]
so that finally we can compute the equation of state for the photon gas: notably photons exhibit a relativistic equation of state, since they are massless, thus the pressure \(p\) and energy density \(u = E/V\) of the photon gas are related by
\[
    p = \frac{1}{3} u, \quad p V = \frac{E}{3}.
\]
This relation arises from the fact that photons are ultrarelativistic particles, and it reflects the isotropic nature of the radiation pressure exerted by the photon gas.

In order to explixit the \textbf{temperature dependence} of the pressure and energy density, we can evaluate the integrals with a change of variable \(x = \beta \epsilon\):
\[
    N = \frac{8 \pi V}{(hc)^3} \left( k_B T \right)^3 \int_0^{\infty} \d{x} \frac{x^2}{e^{x} - 1},
\]
\[
    E = \frac{8 \pi V}{(hc)^3} \left( k_B T \right)^4 \int_0^{\infty} \d{x} \frac{x^3}{e^{x} - 1},
\]
\[
    p = \frac{8 \pi}{(hc)^3} \left( k_B T \right)^4 \int_0^{\infty} \d{x} x^2 \log\left( 1 - e^{-x} \right).
\]
The integrals can be evaluated using the properties of the Riemann zeta function and the Gamma function, but we are not interested in the exact numerical factors here, we will just note the temperature scaling. The key point is that both the energy \(E\) and pressure \(p\) scale with the fourth power of temperature, while the number of photons \(N\) scales with the third power. We could also derive the temperature dependence of the heat capacity \(C_V\) of the photon gas, which is given by
\[
    C_V = \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \right)_V \propto T^3,
\]
indicating that the heat capacity increases rapidly with temperature, reflecting the increasing number of accessible photon states as the temperature rises.

\subsubsection{Spectral Energy Density}

The \textbf{spectral energy density} \(E(\nu,T)\) of the photon gas (\(\epsilon = h \nu\)) describes how the energy is distributed among different photon energies (or frequencies) at a given temperature \(T\). It is defined as
\[
    \frac{E(\nu,T)}{V} = \frac{8\pi}{(hc)^3} \int_0^{h\nu} \d{\epsilon} \frac{\epsilon^3}{e^{\beta \epsilon} - 1}.
\]
Differentiating with respect to frequency \(\nu\), we obtain the spectral energy density per unit frequency:
\[
    u(\nu, T) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} \left( \frac{E(\nu,T)}{V} \right) = \frac{8\pi h }{c^3} \frac{\nu^3}{e^{\beta h \nu} - 1}.
\]
This expression is known as \textbf{Planck's law} of blackbody radiation, which describes the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody at temperature \(T\). It shows that the spectral energy density depends on both the frequency \(\nu\) and the temperature \(T\), with a characteristic peak that shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature increases (Wien's displacement law).

We are interested in studying two particular limits of Planck's law:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rayleigh-Jeans limit} (\(h \nu \ll k_B T\)): In this low-frequency limit, we can approximate the exponential term in the denominator using a Taylor expansion:
          \[
              e^{\beta h \nu} - 1 \approx \beta h \nu.
          \]
          Substituting this approximation into Planck's law, we obtain
          \[
              u(\nu, T) \approx \frac{8\pi h }{c^3} \frac{\nu^3}{\beta h \nu} = \frac{8\pi k_B T}{c^3} \nu^2,
          \]
          which is known as the \textbf{Rayleigh-Jeans law}. This law predicts that the spectral energy density increases with the square of the frequency, leading to the so-called "ultraviolet catastrophe" at high frequencies.

    \item \textbf{Wien's limit} (\(h \nu \gg k_B T\)): In this high-frequency limit, the exponential term in the denominator dominates, and we can approximate it as
          \[
              e^{\beta h \nu} - 1 \approx e^{\beta h \nu}.
          \]
          Substituting this approximation into Planck's law, we obtain
          \[
              u(\nu, T) \approx \frac{8\pi h }{c^3} \nu^3 e^{-\beta h \nu},
          \]
          which is known as \textbf{Wien's law}. This law predicts that the spectral energy density decreases exponentially with increasing frequency, reflecting the suppression of high-energy photons at low temperatures.

These two limits highlight the different behaviors of the spectral energy density in the low and high-frequency regimes, providing insights into the nature of blackbody radiation and the underlying quantum mechanics of photons.
